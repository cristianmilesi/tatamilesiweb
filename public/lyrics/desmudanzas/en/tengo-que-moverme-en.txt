I have to move myself

CHORUS
I have to move…
I have to move…
I have to move myself

There's a clock bleeding out in search of seasons.
Bold, twilight-colored.
The hands rise and fall in their repetitions.
No return — there’s no going back.

There's a voice that threatens me with palpitations,
singing a sharp, clear tick-tock.
From the center of my stomach climb up worries,
each one ready to burn.

CHORUS

There’s nothing left but worn-out deregulations
vibrating, unable to speak.
I’ve got a gust that cuts through my thoughts —
a blunt and raw reality.

I carry on my back a mountain of disillusions,
all of them ready to press down.
To transform, there are a thousand options left,
but staying is no longer one of them.

CHORUS

If I don’t move, I get stepped on,
or kicked by the heavy one —
the one who won’t look to the side,
the one who steals our laughter.
The movement warns aloud:
this thing is burning here,
it won’t sit still and wait,
no matter what the boss may want.
There are those with soft souls,
but boiling hearts full of pain.

(I Am)

I am
An element of time that shifts through space
An organic creation adapting to its surroundings
A natural flow of moods, guts, dreams
That age and move forward, seeking to understand what I…

…Believe

That my path reshapes the static end of this story
That something I search for finds me, though I still don’t understand it
That music embraces my shadow, soothing the lashes
That there are words able to break what I think

I am the unfinished word,
an untouched brush,
matter of time in constant alteration and play.
A heart that discovers itself in the act of questioning.
Sleepless...

…I think
that the laws that rule my being are not yet fixed.
They shift in every gaze, tempering the years
That in the human lies the key to crossing cracks
That I prefer my vulnerable self to burying what I…

…Feel
the warmth of an embrace capable of cleansing my burdens
In my legs, the years of searching and borrowed lives
On my lips, the kisses never given, the parched calm
That in the next attempt lies the taste of life

I am the unfinished word,
an untouched brush,
matter of time in constant alteration and play.
A heart that discovers itself in the act of questioning.
Freedom and sleeplessness.
I am a question mark,
an open project,
anxious hands groping through practice, error, and fear.
Intuition insisting on reasoning
Stirred and lifted.

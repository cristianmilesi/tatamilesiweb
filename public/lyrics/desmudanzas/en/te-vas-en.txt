You're Leaving

Today you're leaving, wielding a heart with no edge.
Your walk vibrates through your body â€” it is pure decision.
Longing for another movement.

You retrace,
trying to treasure the path.
The glowing afternoon sheds its petals and walks with you.

Like in a film, you watch your fears
fighting between memories and illusion.
Oh, sweet flights!
You spin, leaving with each step
silences scented with goodbye.

No more,
you face the unknown.
Slowly echo omens
that reinvent you once again.

Like in a film, you watch your fears
fighting between memories and illusion.
Oh, sweet flights!
You spin, leaving with each step
silences scented with goodbye.

You're leaving, wielding a heart with no edge.
In a moment, an illusion wraps around you.

(The Departure)
Books
overflowing all the way to the balcony door.
Neat
are the shelves, as if a tidy hurricane
were chasing whispering fears.
Half a life secured with cardboard.

I hang up,
and those untouched mate cups grow lukewarm.
Slowly,
the house fills with a final silence.
And the sigh before departure
fills the air with a restless clarity.

Wind
tempts my tear ducts as it brushes my face.
I feel.
I break apart in a moment of zero gravity,
marking the midpoint of the leap,
and I sense that something new has begun.

I speak.
My throat makes a nest for an illusion.
I carry
the early nostalgia of an almost-ending.
And shining, traveling eyes
tell me that everything will be fine.

Doubts

Where are you going?
Why are you doing this without knowing?
What are you thinking?
What’s going to happen to everything you're leaving behind?
Aren’t you afraid of being alone?

Why do you sing?
And what if, in the end, there’s no one who wants to listen?
Do you really believe you can be something more?
How is it that you don’t feel ashamed?

What if it’s over?
Aren’t you too old for such naïveté?
Why are you always dissatisfied?
What are you looking for?
What if you’re just wrong?

You're wasting your time
So short on talent
Your moment has passed
There’s someone better

What if you can’t? What if you're not enough?
Where’s your gift? Why do you get tired?
What is it that you have? When will you grow up?
Who do you think you are? Why are you here?

You're wasting your time
So short on talent
Your moment has passed
There’s someone better

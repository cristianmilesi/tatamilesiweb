(When I Get Lost)

From so much coming and going
From so much change
I no longer know where to go

In the city, I’m not myself
I almost get lost
I search for a place with warmth

Give me a hug that sets me straight for a moment

If I’m tired of wandering
And can’t find my stride
I know I can find you

Give me a hug that sets me straight for a moment

We go on, trying to grow
To break the stillness
We go on, trusting as we do

Give me a hug that sets me straight for a moment

Let your kiss be a place where I find myself
Let your kiss be my home

I know it’s not fair, my love
So many prayers
I offer you my heart

Give me a hug that sets me straight for a moment

Let your kiss be a place where I find myself
Let your kiss be my home (when I get lost)

Let this kiss be a place for us to find each other
Let this kiss become our home

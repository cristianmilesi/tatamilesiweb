Until Here

A decision trembles inside me
A smile fades
My mouth runs dry
I try to hold on and realize
it's better to release the word into the air
slow and clear — a cruel shipwreck.
The reason aches in my chest.

I stumble in my certainty
I come and go
I leave behind so much weight while I store
memories in my backpack
like light, clear photographs. Gentle charm.
Signs of a conclusion.

Until here, the effort has reached.
It hurts — this rush to run away.
I rest, grateful for this story.
Until here, the attempt has reached.
Another bright destiny pulls me away.
I carry my story all at once,
and say goodbye —
until I find you
one more day.

It’s like that autumn chill that catches you off guard —
sudden hint of winter.
My choice sounds like an elegy.

Until here, the effort has reached.
It hurts — this rush to run away.
I rest, grateful for this story.
Until here, the attempt has reached.
Another bright destiny pulls me away.
I carry my story all at once,
and say goodbye —
until I find you
one day,
smiling,
unhurried and happy.
